Feature: Resource collections can be filtered
  As a client
  I want to filter resource collections
  So I get only those items I am interested and save bandwidth by not fetching the items I am not interested in





  Date values should conform to ISO8601. Should you need a different format, you can change the DATE_FORMAT setting.
  - e.g. DATE_FORMAT = '%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S GMT' # RFC1123

    MONGO_QUERY_BLACKLIST
    ALLOWED_FILTERS / allowed_filters
