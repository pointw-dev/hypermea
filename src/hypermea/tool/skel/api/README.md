# {$project_name}

An Eve-based API, created with **[hypermea](https://pointw.com/rapid-api-creation-with-hypermea/)**.

## Getting Started

To launch the service (I recommend you first create a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)):

```bash
hypermea run
```

If you have created this api with docker support (`hypermea api create {$project_name} --add-docker`) then to launch the service with docker-compose:

`docker compose up -d`

If you have created this api with serverless support (`hypermea api create {$project_name} --add-serverless`) then launch with:

`sls wsgi serve -p 2112`


Either way, the API is now running and its base endpoint is

http://localhost:2112


After making changes to the API, you must stop/start the API service.

## Configuration

The API is configured via environment variables.  These can be set in in several ways:

* Your OS

  * `set var=value` in Windows
  *  `export var=value` in Linux

* In `docker-compose.yml`

  ```yml
  environment:
   - var1=value1
   - var2=value2
  ```

* In serverless-XXX.yml

  ```yml
  environment:
    var1: value1
    var2: value2
  ```

* In `_env.conf` (this is useful to set values for use in your IDE, this file is listed in `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` - lines that begin with `#` are treated as comments)  Takes precedence over OS envars.

  ```bash
  var1=value1
  var2=value2
  ```

The base variables are prefixed with HY_ .  The environment variables you can set are:

| Variable                  | Description                                                  | Default                                                     |

| HY_PUBLIC_RESOURCES  | not yet implemented                     |
| HY_URL_PREFIX        | If the API will be deployed behind a URL with a path, use this variable to set that path.  For example, if you deploy the API behind https://example.com/api/my_service, then set HY_URL_PREFIX to "api/my_service" |
| HY_CACHE_CONTROL     | Sets the Cache-Control header (e.g. `no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`) |
| HY_CACHE_EXPIRES     | Sets the Cache-Expires header (value is in secods)           |
| HY_ADD_ECHO          | If enabled, an undocumented endpoint will be created off of the root resource: `_echo`.  PUT {"message": {}, "status_code: int"} to this endpoint and it will be echoed back to you and logged (`.info` if < 400, `.warning` if < 500, else `.error`).  Useful to test the behaviour of error codes (e.g. with logging configurations) |
