"""Adds custom validation module to the API project.

This also adds two new validation rules
- unique_to_parent
    - the field must be unique amongst other resources with the same parent_ref, but can
      be repeated within other parents
- unique_ignorecase
    - prevents the same value being considered unique when the only difference is case
      e.g. 'station #1' will be considered the same as 'Station #1', the rule will
      prevent whichever is second from being inserted.
