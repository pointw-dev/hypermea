# Features

:::tip Note
Almost ALL the functionality you see in the list to the left is working 100%.
We are chasing a few bugs, but the main reason we have not released 1.0.0
Is because we want the best documentation so you can make the most of this amazing
tool set.

What hypermea does for you can be described in two sets of features:

* how hypermea helps you create a hypermedia API
* what your API can do out of the box

That is to say, hypermea provides you with scaffolding tools, and with runtime capabilities.

## Scaffolding tools

With simple commands you generate a fully functional, hypermedia-driven API code base in minutes. No tedious setup.

Before opening your IDE you can add resources, links, affordances. Configure authentication, Git, Docker, and more.

Start with a solid foundation and focus on what matters: your business logic.

## Runtime capabilities

Out of the box your APIs are feature rich, including sorting, pagination, filtering, validation, bulk inserts, and much more.

The APIs you create leverage <b><u><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/">Flask</a></u></b>, are powered by <b><u><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a></u></b>, and are enriched by <b><u><a href="https://docs.python-eve.org/en/stable/index.html">Eve</a></u></b>.  You get the benefits of those libraries without needing to learn them first.

With the <b><u><a href="https://pypi.org/project/hypermea-core/">hypermea-core</a></u></b> library your API is hypermedia-based using <b><u><a href="https://dev.to/nevnet99/wtf-is-hal-hypertext-application-language-2fo6">HAL</a></u></b> to represent your resources.
