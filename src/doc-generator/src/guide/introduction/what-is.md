# What is hypermea?

Hypermea (hy-PER-me-a) is a toolkit that lets you rapidly create production ready, hypermedia driven, microservice compatible APIs.

## Production Ready
When you build your API service with hypermea, out of the box your service has:
* a managed settings configuration system, organized along integration lines 
* sophisticated error handling
* expressive logging
* optional git integration
* optional docker integration
* and so much more

The code generated by hypermea has been battle tested in the most demanding production environments.  You can trust that your services will be robust and reliable.

## Hypermedia-Driven
Hypermedia means using links to navigate and operate an API.  Clients do not need to know how your services are architected.  Client code is truly decoupled from your services.  This lets the back-end team change things server-side without requiring clients to change along.

How is this possible?  The idea is simple - so simple that it's hard to believe it works.  To learn more check out [[TODO]].

## Microservice Compatible
A good microservice is a small, independently deployable service that does one thing well.  A developer can hold the entire service in her head.  Because they are so small, you will need many of them to drive your business. This solves many problems, but it also creates new ones.  
* How do you manage such a large number of services?  
  * Hypermea adopts the [API Gateway pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) which guides clients to the resources they use without having to know anything in advance about your service architecture.
* What happens if a microservice starts out small then grows over time and needs to split into smaller microservices?  
  * Because your services are hypermedia-driven, you can refactor, rearchitect, and rearrange at any time without breaking your clients.

# Okay, but what *is* hypermea?
Hypermea is a package that consists of:
* command-line tools for generating new services and managing existing ones
* a core library that adds features to your services

## Command-line tools
Use simple commands to create your services.  For example, let's start with this resource model:

![Simple resource model](/img/simple-resource-model.png)

To implement this in a single service, you would run these commands:

```bash
hypermea api create order-processing
hypermea resource create customers
hypermea resource create orders
hypermea link create customers orders
```

Each command has multi-level help:
```bash
hypermea --help
hypermea api --help
hypermea api create --help

```

## Core library
Hypermea's core library is an independently distributable package.  It is separate from the command-line tools so your shippables are as lean as possible.  The core library's purpose is primarily to power the functionality of your `hypermea_service`.  It also provides an expanding set of methods to make your customizations easier: for example, access the database, standardize error messages, customize resource representations, and more.
